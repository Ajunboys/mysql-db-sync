DMML has only x tags -

1. <databasemap> : signals the start of the database map
2. <tablemap> : signals start of the table map
3. <source> : when enclosed inside <tablemap></tablemap> tags, it refers to the source table and when enclosed inside <attrmap></attrmap> tags, it refers to the source attribute
4. <dest> : when enclosed inside <tablemap></tablemap> tags, it refers to the destination table and when enclosed inside <attrmap></attrmap> tags, it refers to the destination attribute
5. <sourcetimestamp> : refers to the source table's timestamp attribute
6. <desttimestamp> : refers to the source table's timestamp attribute
7. <attrmap> : signals start of an attribute map; always sits inside a table map
8. <type> : type of attributes in a nattribute map, can only take two values, STRING and NUMERICAL (case-sensitive)

Make sure to close all tags properly. Also, the tags themselves (both opening and closing separately) have to be written on a new line with the tag information in between them on a line of its own.

For a complete understanding, check the sample.dmml file.
